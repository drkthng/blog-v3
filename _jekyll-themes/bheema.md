Bheema is inspired from TheVerge website. I have kept Bheema simpler. All it asks from a post is content and an image. 

Latest posts automatically appear at the top. Quote of the day can be changed in the ``index.html`` file.


Default theme will look like this

![webjeda bheema jekyll theme](http://webjeda.com/bheema/img/bheema-jekyll-theme.png)

This theme is responsive.
